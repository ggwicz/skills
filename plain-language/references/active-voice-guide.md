# Active Voice Guide

From the U.S. federal government Plain Language Guidelines (https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language). Public domain.

## Why it matters

Active voice makes clear who does what. Passive voice obscures responsibility and adds words.

## How to identify passive voice

A sentence is passive when it has BOTH:
1. A form of "to be" — is, are, was, were, be, been, being, could be, have been, will be
2. A past participle — usually ends in "-ed" (approved, completed, required)

Pattern: `[subject] + [to be] + [past participle] + [optional "by" phrase]`

## Before and after

| Passive | Active |

| The following information must be included in the application for it to be considered complete. | You must include the following information in your application. |

## When passive is acceptable

Use passive when:
- The actor is the law itself or truly irrelevant: "If you don't pay, your lease will be terminated."
- You deliberately want to de-emphasize the actor: "Mistakes were made" (though active is usually still better).
- The recipient of the action is the real topic: "The samples were collected over three months" (in a methods section where the focus is on the samples, not the researcher).

In most cases, active voice is stronger. Default to active; use passive only with a reason.
