# Plain Language Review

Review text files against the U.S. federal government Plain Language Guidelines (~30 rules across 6 categories) and produce a structured report of findings with concrete rewrites.

## Review Workflow

1. **Select files** — Use the user's specified files. If none specified, run `scripts/scan-files.sh` to discover all `.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.rst`, and `.adoc` files in the project.
2. **Load rules** — Read `references/rules-quick-ref.md` for the full rule checklist.
3. **Review each file** — For each file, read it and apply all rules. Skip text inside code blocks/fences, inline code, and code-only files. Only review human-readable prose.
4. **Generate findings** — For each issue found, produce a finding using the output format below.
5. **Classify severity** — Use `references/severity-rubric.md` to assign high/medium/low.
6. **Assemble report** — Group findings by file, then by severity (high first).

## Output Format

Use this exact structure for each finding:

```
## [file path]

### Finding [N] — [Rule name] (severity: [high|medium|low])
- **Line [N]:** "[original text]"
- **Guideline:** [One-sentence explanation of the rule violated]
- **Suggested:** "[concrete rewrite]"
```

**Example:**

```
## docs/getting-started.md

### Finding 1 — Use simple words (severity: medium)
- **Line 14:** "In order to utilize the configuration module..."
- **Guideline:** Replace complex words with simple alternatives — "utilize" → "use", "in order to" → "to"
- **Suggested:** "To use the configuration module..."

### Finding 2 — Use active voice (severity: high)
- **Line 23:** "The database will be initialized by the setup script."
- **Guideline:** Make the actor the subject of the sentence
- **Suggested:** "The setup script initializes the database."
```

End the report with a summary:

```
## Summary
- **Files reviewed:** [N]
- **Total findings:** [N] ([N] high, [N] medium, [N] low)
- **Top issues:** [List the 2-3 most frequent rule violations]
```

## When to Load Reference Files

Load references on demand to conserve context:

| File | When to load |
|------|-------------|
| `references/rules-quick-ref.md` | Always — load at start of every review |
| `references/word-substitutions.md` | When checking word choice or when you encounter a word that might have a simpler alternative |
| `references/active-voice-guide.md` | When you detect passive voice patterns (forms of "to be" + past participle) |
| `references/before-and-after-examples.md` | When crafting suggested rewrites — use as transformation models |
| `references/severity-rubric.md` | When classifying findings — consult definitions and examples |

## Key Rules by Priority

**Critical (always flag):**
- Use simple words and phrases (check against the Dirty Dozen first)
- Avoid jargon (unnecessary complexity, not legitimate technical terms)
- Use active voice (passive voice hides responsibility)

**High (flag unless context justifies):**
- Avoid hidden verbs ("make a determination" → "determine")
- Use terms consistently (don't synonym-swap)
- Write short sentences (~20 words)
- Keep subject-verb-object close together
- Use present tense
- Use "must" not "shall" for requirements
- Address the user ("you")
- Place main idea before exceptions

**Medium (flag with lighter touch):**
- Avoid noun strings (3+ stacked nouns)
- Minimize abbreviations
- Write short paragraphs and sections
- Use lists for series
- Use positive language (avoid double negatives)
- Add useful headings
- Cut excess modifiers (really, very, basically, totally, etc.)
- Avoid doublets and triplets ("cease and desist" → "stop", "null and void" → "void")
- Use general-to-specific order (broad info first, specialized details later)
- Use chronological order for processes (steps in the sequence users follow)

**Low (note, don't belabor):**
- Use contractions where natural (context-dependent)
- Don't use slashes ("and/or")
- Minimize cross-references

## Scope Rules

- **Review:** prose in `.md`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc` files; comments in source code files; UI strings; error messages
- **Skip:** code inside fences/backticks, variable names, import statements, configuration values, URLs, file paths
- **Don't rewrite files** — produce recommendations only. The human or agent decides what to apply.
- **Preserve technical terms** — flag jargon only when a simpler alternative exists without losing precision. "Brinulator valve" is fine; "utilize the brinulator valve" is not.
