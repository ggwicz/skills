# Plain Language Rules Quick Reference

Checklist of all rules from the U.S. federal government Plain Language Guidelines (https://digital.gov/guides/plain-language). Public domain.

## Words

| Rule | What to check | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Use simple words | Replace complex words with everyday alternatives. See `word-substitutions.md` for the full table. | Critical |
| Avoid jargon | Cut unnecessary technical, legal, and business jargon. Keep necessary technical terms but simplify the sentence around them. | Critical |
| Avoid hidden verbs | Don't nominalize verbs. "make a determination" → "determine". Watch for -ment, -tion, -sion, -ance endings paired with weak verbs (achieve, effect, give, have, make, reach, take). | High |
| Use terms consistently | Pick one term per concept. Don't synonym-swap ("senior citizens" then "the elderly"). | High |
| Avoid noun strings | Break up 3+ stacked nouns. "land use permit application form" → "application form for a land use permit". | Medium |
| Minimize abbreviations | Use nicknames instead ("the committee" not "ESAC"). Define abbreviations on first use. Limit to 2-3 per document. | Medium |
| Place words carefully | Keep modifiers next to what they modify. Put long conditions after the main clause. | Medium |
| Minimize definitions | If you need many definitions, you're using too much jargon. Define terms inline where you use them, not in a separate section. If a definition section is necessary, place it at the end and list alphabetically. Never define terms you don't use in the document. | Low |

## Conversational

| Rule | What to check | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Use active voice | Make the actor the subject. See `active-voice-guide.md` for identification heuristics. | Critical |
| Use present tense | Prefer present over future. "The system will process" → "The system processes". | High |
| Use "must" for requirements | Replace "shall" with "must" (obligation), "must not" (prohibition), "may" (discretionary), "should" (recommendation). | High |
| Don't use slashes | Replace "and/or" with "or" or "and" or "X, Y, or both". Use hyphens for equal terms ("faculty-student ratio"). | Low |
| Use examples | Add concrete examples for abstract concepts. Write out "for example" or "such as" instead of "e.g." or "i.e." | Medium |
| Use contractions | Use where they sound natural. Context-dependent — some technical docs deliberately avoid them. | Low |

## Concise

| Rule | What to check | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Write short sentences | Target ~20 words. One idea per sentence. Break long sentences at natural division points. | High |
| Keep S-V-O close | Don't insert long clauses between subject, verb, and object. | High |
| Use positive language | Say what to do, not what not to do. Avoid double negatives ("no fewer than" → "at least"). | Medium |
| Write short paragraphs | One topic per paragraph. 150 words max recommended, 250 absolute limit. | Medium |
| Write short sections | Break up long sections. Each section should support a clear, descriptive heading. | Medium |
| Cut excess modifiers | Remove filler modifiers that don't add meaning: absolutely, actually, basically, completely, definitely, essentially, literally, quite, really, simply, totally, very. | Medium |
| Avoid doublets and triplets | Don't pair words that mean the same thing. "due and payable" → "due". "cease and desist" → "stop". "null and void" → "void". "each and every" → "each". | Medium |

## Organize

| Rule | What to check | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Main idea before exceptions | Don't bury the lede. State the rule, then the exception — not the reverse. | High |
| Add useful headings | Use question headings ("How do I apply?") or statement headings ("Apply for a grant") over vague topic headings ("Application"). | Medium |
| Have a topic sentence | Lead each paragraph with its main point. Readers should understand the document by skimming topic sentences. | Medium |
| Use lists | Convert series/sequences to bulleted or numbered lists. Use a lead-in sentence. Max 2-3 nesting levels. | Medium |
| Use general-to-specific order | Put broad information first, addressing most readers in typical situations. Reserve specialized, conditional, and exception details for later sections. | Medium |
| Use chronological order for processes | Arrange procedural or step-by-step content in the sequence users will follow. Application → review → decision, not decision → review → application. | Medium |
| Use transition words | Connect ideas: "however," "for example," "therefore." | Low |

## Audience

| Rule | What to check | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Address the user | Use "you" to speak directly to the reader. Use "we" for your organization. Avoid "he or she" — use "you" instead. | High |
| Address audiences separately | Don't mix instructions for different audiences. Create separate sections. | Low |

## Design (lower priority for text review)

| Rule | What to check | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Highlight important concepts | Use bold/italics for emphasis. Don't overuse — if everything is bold, nothing stands out. | Low |
| Use tables for complex material | Tables over prose for comparative data or if-then conditions. | Low |
| Minimize cross-references | Don't over-link. Repeat information rather than forcing the reader elsewhere. | Low |
